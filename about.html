  <h1>About 'Le 6 Mai 2012'</h1>
<article>
  <p style="padding-bottom:1em; font-size:1em;"><em>"Le 6 Mai 2012 - a day in the life of"</em> was created by <a href="http://twitter.com/basilesimon">Basile Simon</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ma_paradiso">Massimo Paradiso</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/miertl">Michael Ertl</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/padenot">Paul Adenot</a>.</p>
  <p>What do you remember from the French presidential election in 2012? <br>
  Francois Hollande won, yes. Anything else?</p>
  <p>We didn't either, that's why we created <em>"Le 6 Mai - a day in the life of"</em> as an interactive way to re-experience that day.</p>
  <p>Follow a campaigner through his day and use his flat as a hub to choose what you would like to find out more about: the TV news in the morning, Twitter feeds, President Hollande's first speech and celebrations in Place de la Bastille. </p>

  <p>Our project showcases that all elements of a video can be interactive - no matter if they are moving or not. Our aim is to prove that non-linear web documentaries don't have to rely on still images to separate different sections. </p>
  <p>We created a JavaScript library that allows us to track the movement of objects in a video frame by frame. By clicking on the objects, you can trigger whatever we or you implement: opening a link, showing a pop-up window or playing another full-screen video. </p>
  <p>"We" - that is the French-Italian-German connection of Basile Simon, Massimo Paradiso, Michael Ertl and Paul Adenot.</p>
  <p>Massimo and Michael are our storytellers, responsible for enriching the content of a linear narrative. Basile and Paul took on the technical part and created a library that might be valuable for other documentary filmmakers as well.  </p>
  <p>"Le 6 Mai - a day in the life of" is a proof of concept to show what the future of web documentaries and storytelling online could look like. Our project is by no means final: Just imagine you could not only follow one person, but relive a historic day with different people. </p>
  <p style="padding-top: 2em;">The code is open source and can be found on <a href="http://github.com/padenot/popathon-2">Github</a>. This proof of concept was built for demonstration purposes, we do not hold the copyright for all the footage used. </p>
