    <h1>Le 6 mai 2012</h1>
    <p>This web-documentary is a proof-of-concept.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to offer the possibility to revive historical days through a website, embedding technological means to browse the different sources of information.</p>
    <p>On May 6, 2012, the socialist François Hollande was elected President of the French Republic, following Nicolas Sarkozy.<br>
    Many considered that day historical, since the socialists did not succeed in the Elysée race since 1981. Celebrations took place in the Place de la Bastille</p>
